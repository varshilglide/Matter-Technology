Presence Sensor:

1. Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor:
--> This type of sensor can detect the presence of humans or animals by detecting changes in temperature in its field of view.

2. Ultrasonic Sensor:
3. Capacitive Sensor:
--> Capacitive sensors can detect the presence of conductive or non-conductive objects by measuring changes in capacitance.

4. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Sensor: 
--> RFID sensors can detect the presence of RFID tags or cards within their range.
