--> Thread is an IP-based low-power wireless mesh networking protocol that enables secure device-to-device and device-to-cloud communications. 
--> Thread networks can adapt to topology changes to avoid a single point of failure.

--> A Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. 
--> A Thread network requires a Border Router to connect to other networks. 

--> A Thread Border Router minimally supports the following functions:


1. Bidirectional IP connectivity between Thread and Wi-Fi/Ethernet networks.
2. Bidirectional service discovery via mDNS (on Wi-Fi/Ethernet link) and SRP (on Thread network).
3. Thread-over-infrastructure that merges Thread partitions over IP-based links.
External Thread Commissioning (for example, a mobile phone) to authenticate and join a Thread device to a Thread network.

--> OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) released by Google is an open-source implementation of the Thread Border Router.
