Chip-Tool:

Q: What is Chip-Tool?
--> The CHIP Tool (chip-tool) is a Matter controller implementation that allows to commission of a Matter device into the network and to communicate with it using Matter messages, which may encode Data Model actions, such as cluster commands.

--> The tool also provides other utilities specific to Matter, such as parsing of the setup payload or performing discovery actions.

Q: Why do we use Chip-Tool in Matter?
--> Chip tool is a command line tool used for commissioning and testing Matter devices. It can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:

1. Commissioning devices: A chip tool can be used to commission new devices into a Matter network. This involves providing the device with the network's information, such as its security key and the IP address of the network's Matter controller.

2. Testing devices: A chip tool can be used to test the functionality of Matter devices. This can be done by sending commands to the devices and verifying that they respond correctly.

3. Debugging devices: Chip tool can be used to debug problems with Matter devices. This can be done by viewing the logs generated by the devices and by sending them diagnostic commands.+
