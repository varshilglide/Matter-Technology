Q: what is bsp in PCA10056 in nRF52840?

--> BSP stands for Board Support Package. In the context of the nRF52840 Development Kit (PCA10056), the BSP is a set of software libraries and drivers provided by Nordic Semiconductor to help developers get started with developing applications on the nRF52840 SoC.

--> The BSP for PCA10056 includes a range of components, such as device drivers, board configuration files, and example applications. These components are designed to provide a consistent and easy-to-use interface to the hardware features of the nRF52840 DK, such as GPIOs, timers, UARTs, and more.

Some of the key features of the BSP for PCA10056 include:

1. Drivers for all the onboard sensors and interfaces, such as the accelerometer, temperature sensor, and NFC antenna.

2. Example applications that demonstrate how to use the various features of the nRF52840 DK, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, Thread and Zigbee wireless protocols, and more.
Configuration files that help set up the device for specific use cases, such as low-power operation or high-speed data transfer.
 
3. By using the BSP provided by Nordic Semiconductor, developers can quickly get started with developing applications on the nRF52840 DK without needing to write low-level device drivers or configure hardware settings manually. This can help speed up the development process and reduce the time to market for new products.
