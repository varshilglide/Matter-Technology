Q: What is a timer?

--> A timer is a component in a microcontroller or microprocessor that allows precise time measurements and control of events. It is essentially a counter that counts clock cycles and generates an interrupt or trigger signal when a certain number of cycles have elapsed.

--> Timers can be used for a wide range of applications, such as:

1. Generating periodic signals: Timers can be used to generate periodic signals with a precise frequency and duty cycle, such as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals used in motor control or LED dimming.

2. Measuring time intervals: Timers can be used to measure the duration of events or time intervals between events, such as the time between two pulses in a sensor.

3. Delaying actions: Timers can be used to delay actions or trigger events after a certain amount of time has elapsed, such as triggering a sensor reading after a specific delay.

4. Scheduling events: Timers can be used to schedule events to occur at specific times or intervals, such as turning on a device at a specific time of day.

--> There are generally two types of timers: hardware timers and software timers. Hardware timers are built into the microcontroller and are controlled by hardware registers, while software timers are implemented using software code that runs on the microcontroller.

--> Timers are an important component in many embedded systems and are often used in conjunction with other components, such as interrupts, GPIOs, and ADCs, to implement complex functionality.


Q: How to implement a timer?
--> To implement a timer in the nRF52840 microcontroller, you would need to follow these general steps:

1. Configure the timer: Configure the timer registers to set the desired parameters such as frequency, mode of operation, and the number of timer ticks.

2. Start the timer: Start the timer by enabling the timer clock and setting the start value.

3. Handle the timer interrupt: When the timer reaches its set value, an interrupt will be generated. You can write an interrupt handler function to handle the interrupt and perform any desired actions.

4. Stop or reset the timer: After the desired actions have been taken, you may choose to stop or reset the timer to prepare it for the next cycle.
